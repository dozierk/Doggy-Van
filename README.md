# Doggy-Van

I had an idea for a game but also an educational tool so I decided to create an app that encompasses both components.

How to play:

The word will change but the key is knowing whether or not the word is a verb, adjective, or noun...(hence the acronym van)

The user will click on which option they think is correct.

If they choose correctly, the background will flash green.

If they choose incorrectly, the background will flash red.

This game makes use of animation, specifically AVFoundation framework. Also creates the need for arrays and functions.
