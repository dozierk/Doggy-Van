# Doggy-Van

Van is an acronym for verb, adjective, and noun. 


I had an idea for a game but also an educational tool so I decided to create an app that encompasses both components.

How to play:

The word will change but the key is knowing whether or not the word is a verb, adjective, or noun.

The user will click on which option they think is correct.

If they choose correctly, the background will flash green.

If they choose incorrectly, the background will flash red.


This game makes use of basic animation and use of AVFoundation framework. Also creates the need for a custom dictionary that implements the words in a different order every time the game is launched.
