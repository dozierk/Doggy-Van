# Doggy-Van

Van is an acronym for verb, adjective, and noun. 


I had an idea for a game but also an educational tool so I decided to create an app that encompasses both components.

How to play:

The word will change but the key is knowing whether or not the word is a verb, adjective, or noun.

The user will click on which option they think is correct.

If they choose correctly, the word CORRECT will show in the top left of the screen.

If they choose incorrectly, the word INCORRECT will show in the top right of the screen.

This game makes use of basic flip page animation and the MVC design pattern. Implemented  extensions and a temporary custom dictionary which will be replaced with a third party dictionary library at a later time.
